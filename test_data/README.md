# Test data

A test image is available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/volatility-autoruns/BOBBY-PC.raw.gz).

Before submitting a PR, please make sure the output of the plugin matches
`expected_output.json`.

Of course, it's OK to update `expected_output.json` to add the new ASEPs the
plugin may output.

If the test image does not contain any of the ASEPs you're looking for, please
open an issue to see how we can provide an image that does.
